	c.) p → q
	d.) ¬p → ¬q
	e.) p ↔ q X p → q

27.) 
	a.)	base:		If it snows today, I will ski tomorrow				p → q
		converse:	If I will ski tomorrow, then it snows today			q → p
		contrapositive:	If I will not ski tomorrow, then it did not snow today		¬q → ¬p
		inverse: 	If it does not snow today, then I will not ski tomorrow		¬p → ¬q 

41.) (p ∨ q ∨ r) ∧ (¬p ∨ ¬q ∨ ¬r)
	if all are true, then (¬p ∨ ¬q ∨ ¬r) can't be true, making the whole statement false
	if all are false, then (p ∨ q ∨ r) can't be true, making the whole statement false



43.)
	a.) 	 0101 1110
		 0010 0001

	d.)

45.) 0.2; 0.6

47.) 0.8; 0.6

49.)
	a.) If true, then n are false and 100-n are true; else if false, then the number of false statements is certainly not n
	X: apparently it means n = 99 is true, the rest are false | e.g., with n = 50, then 51 statements are true (contradiction)
	b.) If true, then [n,100] statements are false; if false, then fewer than 100-n statements are false
	X: fifty-fofty split
	c.) same, but replace 100 w/ 99
	X: impossible
