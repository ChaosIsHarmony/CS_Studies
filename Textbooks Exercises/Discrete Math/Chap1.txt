	g.) If and only if swimming is allowed at the NJ shore, then sharks have not been spotted near the shore
	h.) Swimming is not allowed at the NJ shore and either swimming is allowed at the NJ shore or sharks have not been spotted near the shore

11.)
	a.) p ∧ q
	b.) p ∧ ¬q
	c.) ¬p ∧ ¬q
	d.) q ∨ p
	e.) p → q
	f.) (p ∨ q) ∧ (p → ¬q)
	g.) p ↔ q

13.)
	a.) ¬p 
	b.) p ∧ ¬q 
	c.) p → q
	d.) ¬p → ¬q
	e.) p ↔ q X p → q
	f.) q ∧ ¬p
	g.) q → p

27.) 
	a.)	base:		If it snows today, I will ski tomorrow				p → q
		converse:	If I will ski tomorrow, then it snows today			q → p
		contrapositive:	If I will not ski tomorrow, then it did not snow today		¬q → ¬p
		inverse: 	If it does not snow today, then I will not ski tomorrow		¬p → ¬q 

41.) (p ∨ q ∨ r) ∧ (¬p ∨ ¬q ∨ ¬r)
	if all are true, then (¬p ∨ ¬q ∨ ¬r) can't be true, making the whole statement false
	if all are false, then (p ∨ q ∨ r) can't be true, making the whole statement false



43.)
	a.)	 0101 1110
		 0010 0001
	 	&0000 0000
		|0111 1111
	  XOR1000 0000		 
	b.)	1111 0000
		1010 1010
	 	&1010 0000
		|1111 1010
	  XOR1010 01010

45.) 0.2; 0.6

47.) 0.8; 0.6

49.)
	a.) If true, then n are false and 100-n are true; else if false, then the number of false statements is certainly not n
	X: apparently it means n = 99 is true, the rest are false | e.g., with n = 50, then 51 statements are true (contradiction)
	b.) If true, then [n,100] statements are false; if false, then fewer than 100-n statements are false
	X: fifty-fofty split
	c.) same, but replace 100 w/ 99
	X: impossible

SECTION 1.2 [10 problems]

1.) ¬a → ¬e  |  ¬(¬a ∧ e)

3.) g → (¬m ∧ r ∧ ¬b)

5.) e → (a ∧ (b ∨ p) ∧ r)

7.)
	a.) q → p
	b.) q ∧ ¬p
	c.) q → p
	d.) ¬q → ¬p
	
9.) Consistent? No, 1 implies ¬m, but 4 implies m; a contradiction
	The system is in multiuser state	= m
	The system is operating normally	= o
	The kernel is functioning			= f
	The system is in interrupt mode		= i
	1.) m ↔ o	=> ¬o → ¬m
	2.) o → f	=> ¬f → ¬o
	3.) ¬f ∨ i	=> ¬f
	4.) ¬m → i	=> ¬i → m
	5.) ¬i

11.) Consistent? Yes, no contradictions
	 The router can send packets to the edge system	= r
	 The router supports the new address space		= s
	 The latest software release is installed		= i
	 1.) s → r	=> ?
	 2.) i ↔ s	=> ¬i
	 3.) i → r	=> ?
	 4.) ¬s

13.) beaches AND "New Jersey"
	 beaches AND "the isle of Jersey"

15.) Which road leads back to the village and which of the two remaining roads lead to the Ruins?
	 Book answer: If I were to ask you if the right path lead to the Ruins, would you answer yes?
					- Nice because it asks the liar to lie about lying, leading to a double negative and thus the truth

17.) The first two professors want coffee, but the last one doesn't.
	 If the first had said 'No', then he would not want coffee
	 Same with the second

19.) A is a knight = a
	 B is a knight = b
	 1.) a → ¬b | b → ¬a
	 2.) ¬a is impossible, because ¬a → ¬b | b → a, but then a is telling the truth and that implies a
	 Thus: a ∧ ¬b
	 
21.)
		¬ ∨ ∧ → ↔
